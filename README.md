## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was a great way to practice positioning with flexbox. Also, I was able to learn a few tricks to do the active states as shown in the code below.The simplest solution usually is the most elegant one.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.overlay {
  opacity: 0;
}
.overlay:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on the basic concepts. Although they are easy to grasp I believe it is never enough to practice them.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Always a life saver to check the syntax and the properties of css.
- [Opacity Hover](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp) - This helped me with the active state in the card image.
